         </ul>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the noodles: </strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente according to package directions, usually 10 minutes.<br>
                Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain well. Set aside. </li>
                <li><strong>Make the chicken: </strong>Season chicken breasts with the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Once it’s shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute. Add the chicken and leave it undisturbed for <br>
                    5-7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. Flip over and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, picking up the pan to give it a gentle swirl to distribute. Continue <br>
                    cooking for another 5-7 minutes (or an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.)</li>
                <li><strong>Make the Alfredo Sauce: </strong>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Tent with foil while you prepare<br>
                    the sauce.</li>
                <li>In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter and cream; whisk until butter has melted.</li>
                <li>Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and smooth.</li>
                <li>Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken.</li>
                <li>Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth. (If the sauce ends up too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at <br>
                    a time, to thin it out.)</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble: </strong>Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettuccine noodles.</li>
                <li>Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
