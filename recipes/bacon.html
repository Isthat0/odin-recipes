    <h1>BACON!!</h1>

    <h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
    <p>Baking bacon at 350 degrees F is the way to get crisp bacon without having to constantly turn it,<br>
        watch over it, or get burnt by splatters of grease.It "fries" up flat and doesn't curl, which <br>
        looks great beside a breakfast plate of eggs,and makes BLT sandwiches much easier. Very nice <br>
        when feeding a family or crowd.</p>
    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Arrange the bacon in a single layer on the prepared sheet with the edges touching or <br>
            lightly overlapping.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven to desired degree of doneness, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove <br>
            bacon from the baking sheet with tongs or a fork, and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
